        <p>My favourite character is Naruto Uzumaki from an anime named 'Naruto'. He is my favourite because he is very powerful, friendly and sensible. But before all this he was considered a threat to the village he lived in since he had a beast sealed inside him by his father who was the hokage(the seniormost person in the village). He was made fun of and no one came near him. But despite of all of this he grew up and made many friends, became powerful and gradually became the hokage after defeating many formidable enemies. After this he was respected and never made fun of. This is why he is my favourite character.</p>
